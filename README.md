Question 1 : Write a program to get data from API and write it to excel.
The below API returns JSON response. Get the data from API and save as excel. The first row in
the excel file should be header with same column names as JSON keys.


import pandas as pd  //first ,Installed pandas and imported it as pd
url = 'https://606f76d385c3f0001746e93d.mockapi.io/api/v1/auditlog'  //
x = pd.read_csv(url)   //used .read_csv function for reading any delimited text file
s=x.describe()    //  describe() is used to view some basic statistical details 
print(s)  
s.to_excel('test.xlsx')  // to_excel() method is used to export the DataFrame to the excel file

QUESTION 2
Write a program which accepts text input from user and saves it in a text file. This file should be
saved in a directory named after todayâ€™s date(dd-mm-yyyy). A new file should be created each
time the user runs this program. Feel free to have any file name of your choice.


import time
import os
timestr = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")  // used time module function to get current date 
directory = timestr  
parent_dir = "D:\coding"
path = os.path.join(parent_dir, directory) 
if os.path.isdir(path): // checking if the directory with the same name already exists 
    pass
else:
    os.mkdir(path) // creating directory if directory does not exit
    print("Directory '% s' created" % directory)
os.chdir(path)  // changing directory to newly created directory 
where = input('name of the file  ')
text = input('taking input from user ')
saveFile = open(where, 'w')
saveFile.write(text)
saveFile.close()

Question3 

Write a python class that is able to find three available WiFi networks with the strongest signal
and connect to the one where the password is provided.

import subprocess
import os
dw = subprocess.check_output(['netsh','wlan','show','network'])                           # using the check_output() for having the wifi network retrival
decoded_dw = dw.decode('ascii')                                                           # decode it to strings
print(decoded_dw)                                                                         # displaying the  available wifi  information                                                                                                 
ssid = input('Enter Name/SSID of the Wifi Network you wish to connect to: ')    # input Wifi name  
passwd = input('Enter password') # input password 
output = subprocess.check_output(['sudo', 'nmcli', 'device', 'wifi', 'connect', ssid,'password', passwd]) // trying to connect to given ssid with password using nmcli command 

after this i was getting below error while trying to connect to given ssid ,was not able to debug further
